The primary objective of the (MEDICARE)Doctor Appointment Booking System is to create a comprehensive web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to automate and streamline the scheduling and management of medical appointments. This system is designed to enhance accessibility by providing a user-friendly interface, allowing patients to easily search for doctors by specialty, view available appointment slots, and book appointments online. By doing so, it aims to improve the efficiency of appointment scheduling, significantly reducing the manual effort and administrative workload typically associated with managing appointments, thereby enabling healthcare providers to dedicate more time to patient care.
